signal_labels: extract genomic signal sequence with flanking regions. 

Extract the genomic signal sequence like Transcription Start Site [TSS], 
Translational Initiation Site [TIS] and splice sites [donor, acceptor] 
signals with flanking genomic regions from the genome annotation in GTF/GFF 
and genome sequence in FASTA format.

The number of signal labels are extracted randomly from each chromosome, 
User has the flexibility for selection of different number of positive and 
negative signal labels. The flanking region length can be adjusted according
to the experiment setup. The result file with extracted positive and negative 
labels are written in FASTA format.
